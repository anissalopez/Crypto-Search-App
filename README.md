Crypto Price Search is an app that allows you to easily search for current prices of crypto-currency by name or by price range. 




## Description

This app utilizes the promise-based Fetch API method to access data from the coincap api. The app has three files -- an html, javaScript and css file. The app primarily utilizes JavaScript to manipulate the data received from the coincap api. The app does this through several unique JavaScript event listeners -- a submit event listener that allows the user to search for a crypto-currency by name, a change event listener that gives the user the ability to utilize a drop-down menu to search for crypto-currency by price range, a click event listener that allows the user to clear the DOM elements from the page and a mouseover event listener that adds more interactivity by giving the user the ability to see the 24 hour percent change in price when a user hovers over the respective crypto-currency's name.
